    <p>Alright, let's rewind a bit.</p>
    <p>It all started when I thought coding was just "typing random magic into a black screen" and somehow building games, websites, or hacking the school Wi-Fi (which, btw, I still haven't done. Yet ðŸ‘€)</p>
    <p>I didn't grow up writing code on paper napkins or building robots at age 5. Nah. I came to know about programming when I was in class 11.</p>
    <p>The first programming language I was introduced with was - <b>Python</b>. It was rather more like a subject to me than being a programming language. Along with Python, <B>MySQL</B> also became a part of the syllabus. For those two years, I mastered only Python and MySQL. I made some mini projects using Python like - calculator, quiz, score analyzer, cafe ordering program, magic 8-ball game and so-on (I will be adding the source code of such mini projects, once I get a good traffic on my website  \(^_^)/  ).</p>

    <p>After my school ended, I was looking for - "What to do Next?", "What should I aim for?" & most importantly "Is it worth learning programming in this AI ERA?". and then I found this youtube channel - CodeWithHarry. It helped me a lot in clearing my doubts. My journey was more like:</p>
    <p><b>Step 1: </b>Watched a cool anime - Naruto where shinobis make hand signs to do jutsus.</p>
    <p><b>Step 2: </b>Opened Google.</p>
    <P><B>Step 3: </B>Typed "how to learn coding in 2025" although I knew python but I wanted a roadmap.</P>
    <p><b>Step 4: </b>Cried.</p>

    <h2>ðŸ§© My Actual First Step: HTML & CSS</h2>
    <P>I started with HTML and CSS thinking:</P>
    <blockquote>
      "Okay, this is kinda cute. I can make buttons and change colors."
    </blockquote>
    <p>No logic. No loops. Just pure vibes and chaos.</p>
    <p>I didn't even know what a <mark> div </mark> was. I literally thought it meant <italic>divide</italic> ðŸ’€. But when I saw my first page come to life? Addicted.</p>
    <p>Then someone said:</p>
    <blockquote>
      "Frontend is easy. Try JavaScript."
      Me: Okay.
      Also me: regrets instantly.
    </blockquote>
    
    <hr class="divider">
    
    <h2>ðŸ§  Enter JavaScript: The Brain Hurts Era</h2>
    <p>JS broke me.</p>
    <p>Variables, functions, the DOM?? I just realized:</p>
    <blockquote>
      "So, Java and JavaScript are two different languages. And the one I want is Java."
    </blockquote>
    <p>I dived into Java.</p>
    
    <hr class="divider">
    
    <h2>â˜• Java: Hello Pain, My Old Friend</h2>
    <p>Then came Java.</p>
    <p>Some genius online said,"Java has strict rules, so it's good for beginners."</p>
    <p><b>It literally yelled at me for everything.</b></p>
    <p><mark> public static void main(String[] args) </mark> - why so extra, Java?</p>
    <p>But the truth is, Java did teach me how to be precise, organised, and patient (sometimes...).</p>
    
    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>ðŸ›  What I'd Do Differently Today</h2>
    <p>Now that I've survived the "coding chaos phase", here's what I'd tell Past Me:</p>
    
    <h3><b>1. Stop Trying to Learn Everything At Once</b></h3>
    <p>Spoiler: You don't need to learn all the languages in the first month. Pick one. Go deep. I was switching from Python to JavaScript to Java like I was collecting PokÃ©mons. Finally, I went deeper into Java.</p>
    
    <h3><b>2. Projects > Tutorials</b></h3>
    <p>Tutorials are great, but real learning starts when things break and no one is there to save you.
      Start small. A to-do list. A simple game. A blog like this. Just build something.
    </p>

    <h3><b>3. Notion, VS code, and Dark Mode = Besties</b></h3>
    <p>Productivity apps and tools matter. Notion helped me organize my chaos.
      VS Code made me feel powerful. Dark mode? Saved my eyeballs.
    </p>

    <h3><b>4. Imposter Syndrome is Normal</b></h3>
    <p>You'll feel like a fraud. Like everyone knows more than you.
      Ignore it. Everyone's secretly winging it.
    </p>

    <h3><b>5. Celebrate Small Wins ðŸŽ‰</b></h3>
    <p>Got a button to work? Celebrate.
      Deployed your first page? Scream about it.
      Coding isn't about being perfect. It's about being perfect. It's about showing up again and again.
    </p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>I'm still learning. Still messing up. Still yelling at my screen.</p>
    <p>But that's the fun part. Every error, every crash, every "it finally works!!" moment - it's all part of this journey.</p>
    <p>So if you're just starting: You got this.</p>
    <p>If you're halfway through: Keep going.</p>
    <p>And if you're ahead of me: Wait up bro ðŸ˜© I'm catching up.</p>
    <p>See you in the next post âœŒ</p>
